Critical thinking is described by Richard Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–198|quote=|via=}}</ref> The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as 
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995),  critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first=James R. | last=Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014 |website =myweb.wvnet.edu |publisher = }}</ref> The National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}</ref> defines critical thinking as the "<nowiki>intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.</nowiki>"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In the term '''critical thinking''', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word '''critic''' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".<ref>Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.</ref>

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as:
* "the process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion"<ref name="reference.com">{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/critical|title=Critical - Define Critical at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref>
* "disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence"<ref name="reference.com"/>
* "reasonable, reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.education.illinois.edu/rhennis/SSConcCTApr3.html|title=SSConceptionCT.html|publisher=}}</ref>
* "purposeful, [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] judgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF|format=PDF|last=Facione|first=Peter A. |title=Critical Thinking: What It is and Why It Counts|publisher=insightassessment.com|year=2011|page= 26}}</ref>
* "includes a commitment to using reason in the formulation of our beliefs"<ref name=mulnix>{{cite journal | last1 = Mulnix | first1 = J. W. | year = 2010 | title = Thinking critically about critical thinking | url = | journal = Educational Philosophy and Theory | volume = | issue = | page = 471 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-5812.2010.00673.x }}</ref>
* in [[critical social theory]], it is the commitment to the social and political practice of participatory democracy; willingness to imagine or to remain open to considering alternative perspectives; willingness to integrate new or revised perspectives into our ways of thinking and acting; and willingness to foster criticality in others.<ref name="Raiskums, B.W. 2008">Raiskums, B.W. (2008). ''An Analysis of the Concept Criticality in Adult Education.'' Capella University. ISBN 0549778349{{page needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>
* the skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective scepticism (McPeck, 1981)
* disciplined, self-directed thinking which exemplifies the perfection of thinking appropriate to a particular mode or domain of thinking (Paul, 1989, p.&nbsp;214)
* thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.<ref>Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.</ref>

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Previously, critical thinking excluded these subjective practices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

==Logic and rationality==
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking.

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:<ref>Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath , Christopher P. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York, USA: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.</ref>
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context{{Clarify|date=March 2013}}
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., & And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking. Final Project Report (ISBN 0-16-048051-5; NCES-95-001)|work= from National Center on Postsecondary Teaching, Learning, and Assessment, University Park, PA.; Office of Educational Research and Improvement (ED), Washington, DC.; U.S. Government Printing Office, Superintendent of Documents, Mail Stop: SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-9328. PUB TYPE - Reports Research/Technical (143) pp. 14–15|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED383255.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref>

==Procedure==
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."<ref name=glaser>{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=0-404-55843-7 }}</ref>

==Habits or traits of mind==
The habits of mind that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, inquisitiveness, even-handedness, and confidence in reasoning.<ref>The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423</ref>

According to a definition analysis by Kompf & Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]], rationality, rational thinking, reasoning, knowledge, intelligence and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

==Research==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:<ref name=glaser/>

#An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
#Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
#Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.<ref>Solomon, S.A. (2002) "Two Systems of Reasoning," in ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment'', Govitch, Griffin, Kahneman (Eds), Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-79679-8; ''Thinking and Reasoning in Human Decision Making: The Method of Argument and Heuristic Analysis'', Facione and Facione, 2007, California Academic Press.  ISBN 978-1-891557-58-3</ref>

The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question. Some people have both in abundance, some have skills but not the disposition to use them, some are disposed but lack strong skills, and some have neither. A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46</ref>

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.<ref>Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath & Co.</ref>

Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning. Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters<ref>Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''''Italic text''Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.</ref> compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school system, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.<ref>[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{wayback|url=http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=20080411150135 |df=y }}</ref> Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}</ref>

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.<ref>[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{wayback|url=http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=20080217221100 |df=y }}</ref>

[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], Critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]] which is an out-reach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |archivedate=19 April 2014 }}</ref>



===Efficacy===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher education was undertaken.<ref>Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995</ref>
The study noted concerns from higher education, politicians and business that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' thinking skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of cognition, rather than developing intellect or values.

==Importance in academia==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]].

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure their thinking, thereby decreasing the risk of adopting, acting on, or thinking with, a false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}</ref> Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}</ref>

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."<ref>Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking (1999) {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x}}</ref> Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario - Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).<ref>College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for 
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)]</ref>
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."<ref>{{cite web|work=UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref>

Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true, partially true, or false. It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process.
