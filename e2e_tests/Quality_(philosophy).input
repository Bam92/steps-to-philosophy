{{about|quality in the philosophical sense||Quality (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], a '''quality''' (from {{lang-la|qualitas}})<ref>Morwood, J. (Ed.) (1995). ''The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary.'' Oxford</ref> is an attribute or a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]].<ref name="Cargile, 1995">Cargile, J. (1995). qualities. in Honderich, T. (Ed.) (2005). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2nd ed.). Oxford</ref> In [[contemporary philosophy]] the [[idea]] of qualities, and especially how to distinguish certain kinds of qualities from one another, remains controversial.<ref name="Cargile, 1995"/>

==Background==
{{further|Property (philosophy)}}
[[Aristotle]] analyzed qualities in his [[logic]]al work, the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. To him, qualities are [[hylomorphic]]ally–formal attributes, such as "white" or "grammatical". Categories of ''state'', such as "shod" and "armed" are also non–[[essential property|essential]] qualities ''([[sumbebekos|katà symbebekós]])''.<ref name="MIT_Cat_70">{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#70 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 70.</ref> Aristotle observed: "one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so".<ref name="MIT_Cat_254">{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 254.</ref> Aristotle described four types of qualitative opposites: ''correlatives,'' ''contraries,'' ''privatives'' and ''positives.''<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.3.3.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 28.</ref>

[[John Locke]] presented a distinction between primary and secondary qualities in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. For Locke, a quality is an [[idea]] of a [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] or a [[perception]]. Locke further asserts that qualities can be divided in two kinds: primary and secondary qualities. [[Primary qualities]] are [[intrinsic]] to an object—a thing or a person—whereas [[secondary qualities]] are dependent on the interpretation of the subjective mode and the context of appearance.<ref name="Cargile, 1995"/> For example, a [[shadow]] is a secondary quality. It requires a certain [[light]]ing to be applied to an object. For another example, consider the [[mass]] of an object. [[Weight]] is a secondary quality since, as a [[measurement]] of gravitational [[force]], it varies depending on the [[distance]] to, and mass of, very massive objects like the [[Earth]], as described by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law]]. It could be thought that mass is intrinsic to an object, and thus a primary quality. In the context of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], the idea of mass quantifying an amount of [[matter#Relativity|matter]] requires caution. The [[relativistic mass]] varies for variously traveling observers; then there is the idea of rest mass or [[invariant mass]] (the magnitude of the [[Four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]]<ref>[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, p. 195.</ref>), basically a system's relativistic mass in its own [[rest frame]] of reference. (Note, however, that Aristotle drew a distinction between qualification and quantification; a thing's quality can vary in degree).<ref name="studman 2007">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/#Quality |author=Studtmann,P. |year=2007 |title=Aristotle's Categories |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=E.N. |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location=Stanford |quote=[Regarding] ''Habits and Dispositions; Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities; Affective Qualities and Affections;'' and ''Shapes;'' [...] Ackrill finds Aristotle's division of quality at best unmotivated.}}</ref> Only an [[isolated system]]'s invariant [[Mass in general relativity|mass in relativity]] is the same as observed in variously traveling observers' rest frames, and [[Conserved quantity|conserved]] in reactions; moreover, a system's heat, including the energy of its massless particles such as photons, contributes to the system's invariant mass (indeed, otherwise even an isolated system's invariant mass would not be conserved in reactions); even a cloud of photons traveling in different directions has, as a whole, a rest frame and a rest energy equivalent to invariant mass.<ref>[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, pp. 226-227 and 232-233.</ref>  Thus, to treat rest mass (and by that stroke, rest energy) as an intrinsic quality distinctive of physical matter raises the question of what is to count as physical matter. Little of the invariant mass of a [[hadron]] (for example a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]]) consists in the invariant masses of its component [[quark]]s (in a proton, around 1%) apart from their [[gluon]] [[Quantum field theory|particle field]]s; most of it consists in the [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]] of the (massless) gluons (see [[Quark#Mass]]).

==Conceptions of quality as metaphysical and ontological==
{{main article|Qualia}}
[[Philosophy]] and [[common sense]] tend to see qualities as [[relate]]d either to [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[feeling]]s or to [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[fact]]s. The qualities of something depends on the criteria being applied to and, from a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], do not determine its value (the [[philosophical value]] as well as [[economic value]]). Subjectively, something might be [[form of the good|good]] because it is [[utility|useful]], because it is [[Beauty|beautiful]], or simply because it [[existence|exists]]. Determining or finding qualities therefore involves [[understanding]] what is useful, what is beautiful and what exists. Commonly, ''quality'' can mean degree of [[excellence]], as in, "a quality product" or "work of average quality". It can also refer to a property of something such as "the [[addictive]] quality of [[nicotine]]".<ref>{{cite book

</ref> In his book, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', [[Robert M. Pirsig]] examines concepts of quality in [[classicism|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]], seeking a [[Metaphysics of Quality]] and a reconciliation of those views in terms of [[non-dualism|non-dualistic]] [[holism]].
