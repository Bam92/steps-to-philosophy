A '''systematic process''' is often closely associated with [[critical thinking]].<ref>Elaine B. Johnson, ''Contextual teaching and learning: what it is and why it's here to stay'', 2002, p.103</ref>

In general the application of a systematic process is regarded as a means of management aimed at reducing the number and severity of mistakes, errors and failures due to either [[human error|human]] or [[mechanical failure|technological]] functions involved. 

Use of systematic process in [[strategic planning]] has been both challenged due to rapid change in market conditions, and advocated as a source of improvement.<ref>Rudolf Gr√ºnig, ''Process-based Strategic Planning'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006, pp.45-46</ref> For example, "Many OECD countries have a transparent and systematic process of public consultation to enhance the quality of the regulatory process by guaranteeing that the impact on citizens and businesses is taken into account."<ref>''China: defining the boundary between the market and the state'', OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2009, p.113</ref>
