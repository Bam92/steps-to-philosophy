A '''team sport''' includes any [[sport]] which involves two or more [[team|players working together]] towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[water polo]], [[handball]], [[lacrosse]], [[cricket]], [[baseball]], and the various forms of [[football]] and [[hockey]].

==Overview==
Team sports are practiced between opposing teams, where the players interact directly and simultaneously between them to achieve an objective. The objective generally involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points.

However, other types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar item in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. For example, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], [[dragon boat racing]], and [[track and field]] among others are also team sports.{{Sfn|Baofu|2014|p=202}}
In other types of team sports there may not be an opposing team or point scoring, for example, [[mountaineering]]. Instead of points scored against an opposing team, the relative difficulty of the climb or walk is the measure of the achievement.

In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams but also against each other for points towards championship standings. For example, [[motorsport]], particularly [[Formula One]]. In [[Cycling team|cycling]] however, team members whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one, usually a specialist, member of the team to the highest possible finishing position. This process is known as [[team orders]] and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One<ref>[http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/07images/f1/fia/033007_2008_F1_SPORTING_REGULATIONS.pdf 2008 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations]</ref> between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving [[team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix]] however, the regulation was removed as of the {{f1|2011}} season.<ref>[http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/9A195FD4A47DA4E1C12577F8004AA63E/$FILE/1-2011%20SPORTING%20REGULATIONS%2010-12-2010.pdf 2010 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations]</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of sport}}
Sprinting as a team sport has ancient history of several thousand years as evidenced in the engravings on the cave in [[Lascaux]] in France which depicts people running after animals or vice versa; this was an issue of survival of the fittest.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=25}}

Organized sports in athletics, started in Greece in 796 BC, is recorded up to 393 BC. These games, which are Olympic games, were a form to test the skills of warriors, consisted of [[running]], [[jumping]] or leaping, [[wrestling]] (combat sport), and javelin throw. {{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}} In the [[Bayankhongor Province]] of [[Mongolia]] cave paintings dating back to Neolithic age of 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110317/PC20/303179904 |last=Hartsell|first= Jeff|title= Wrestling 'in our blood|publisher= Bulldogs' Luvsandor|accessdate= 25 October 2015}}</ref> Cave paintings of the [[Prehistoric]] times in [[Japan]] show a sport similar to [[sumo]] wrestling.<ref name="Crego2003">{{cite book|author=Robert Crego|title=Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCl1c2yy5ooC&pg=PA34|accessdate=25 October 2015|year=2003|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-313-31610-4|pages=34–}}</ref> In [[Wadi Sura]], near [[Gilf Kebir]] in [[Libya]], [[Neolithic]] in the [[cave of swimmers]] shows evidence of [[human swimming|swimming]] in a rock painting and [[archery]] being practiced around 6000 BC.<ref name="Vörös2007">{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907–2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC&pg=PA39|accessdate=25 October 2015|year=2007|publisher=[[American Univ in Cairo Press]]|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|pages=39–}}</ref>

The name "athletes" is derived from  [[Aethelius]], the King of Elis in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], Greece. The practice of carrying flaming torches by young athletes is also traced to the King of Elis, under whose super vision the games were held; it is claimed by some Historians as the first record of Olympic Sprint racing. Before the start of the races gods were invoked by offering of mostly fruits and vegetables. The winner of the race was crowned with a wreath of olive or [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] and cereal sticks were offered as a  trophy. In subsequent years monetary attractions were introduced as prize money. However, the practice of offering [[celery sticks]] is still in vogue in the 100&nbsp;m sprint in the Olympics.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}}

The present pattern of [[Olympic Games]] is akin to the practice followed in the ancient days. Sprint was the coveted event. The 200&nbsp;m sprint is known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as "short foot race". The 400&nbsp;m race is equivalent to two ''stades'' and called ''Diaulos'' in Greek.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}}

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===
With the advent of [[computer gaming]] and the [[Internet]], [[Esports]] which is in vogue for quite a few years was recorded in October 1972 as a video game. A Space war tournament was organized by [[Stanford University]] which was titled "Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics" with a prize offering of one-year subscription to ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.{{Sfn|Hiltscher|Scholz|2015|p=9}}

==Olympic team sports==
Seven team sports are currently on the program of the [[Summer Olympics]].  [[Cricket]]'s inclusion in the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] depends on the decision of the [[International Cricket Council]] and its members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joc4rmEsPr3msn6leaEdvZ1-SnKA |title=Cricket edges closer to Olympic roster |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815194518/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joc4rmEsPr3msn6leaEdvZ1-SnKA |archivedate=15 August 2012}}</ref> A [[Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics|cricket tournament]] formed part of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], although only one match was played, between teams representing Great Britain and France.

[[Ice hockey]] and [[curling]] are team sports at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] together with the [[Bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics|bobsleigh]] competition where the men's event has classes for both two-man and four-man sleds, but the women's class is restricted to two persons only.<ref>{{cite web|title=BOBSLEIGH|url=http://www.olympic.org/bobsleigh|publisher=International Olympic Committee|year=2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref>
