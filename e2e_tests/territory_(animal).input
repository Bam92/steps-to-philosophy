In [[ethology]], '''territory''' is the sociographical area that an [[animal]] of a particular [[species]] consistently defends against [[conspecificity|conspecifics]] (or, occasionally, animals of other species). Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as '''territorial'''.

Territoriality is only shown by a minority of species. More commonly, an individual or a group of animals will have an area that it habitually uses but does not necessarily defend; this is called the [[Home Range|home range]]. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, or in the overlap areas, the groups will tend to avoid each other rather than seeking to expel each other. Within the home range there may be a ''core area'' that no other individual group uses, but, again, this is as a result of avoidance.

==Function==
The ultimate function of animals inhabiting and defending a territory is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals expressing the behaviour.  Fitness in this biological sense relates to the ability of an animal to survive and raise young.  The proximate functions of territory defense vary. For some animals, the reason for such protective behaviour is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to attract a mate.

==Types and size==
Territories have been classified as six types.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdterritories.html|author=Anon.|title=Territoriality and coloniality|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>

*Type A: An 'all-purpose territory' in which all activities occur, e.g. courtship, mating, nesting and foraging. Common in songbirds.
*Type B: A mating and nesting territory in which all breeding activities occur, but most foraging occurs elsewhere. 
*Type C: A nesting territory which includes the nest plus a small area around it. Common in colonial waterbirds.
*Type D: A pairing and mating territory. The type of territory defended by males in lekking species.
*Type E: Roosting territory. 
*Type F: Winter territory which typically includes foraging areas and roost sites. May be equivalent (in terms of location) to the Type A territory, or for a migratory species, may be on the wintering grounds.

Reports of territory size can be confused by a lack of distinction between home range and the defended territory.  The size and shape of a territory can vary according to its purpose, season, the amount and quality of resources it contains, or the geography.  The size is usually a compromise of resource needs, defense costs, predation pressure and reproductive needs.

Some species of [[squirrels]] may claim as much as 10 hectares of territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/squirrel-behavior-territory-4745.html|title=Squirrel behaviour and territory|author=Turpin, K.|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>
For [[European badger]]s, a home range may be as small as 30 hectares in a good rural habitat, but as large as 300 hectares in a poor habitat. On average, a territory may be approximately 50 hectares, with main setts normally at least 500 metres apart. In urban areas, territories can be as small as 5 hectares, if they can obtain enough food from bird tables, food waste or artificial feeding in suburban gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.badgerland.co.uk/animals/family/territories.html|title=Territories|author=Anon.|publisher=www.badgerland.co.uk|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>  [[Spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') have highly variable territory sizes, ranging from less than 4,000 hectares in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 100,000 hectares in the Kalahari.<ref>Kruuk, H., (1972).  ''The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour''.  University of California Press, ISBN 0226455084</ref>

In birds, [[golden eagles]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') have territories of 9,000 hectares, [[least flycatcher]]s' (''Empidonax minimus'') territories are about 600 square metres and [[gulls]] have territories of only a few square centimetres in the immediate vicinity of the nest.<ref name="Ehrlich">{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Territoriality.html|title=Territoriality|author=Ehrlich, P.R., Dobkin, D.S. and Wheye, D.|year=1998|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref>

Territories can be linear.  [[Sanderling]]s (''Calidris alba'') forage on beaches and sandflats.  When on beaches, they feed either in flocks or individual territories of 10 to 120 metres of shoreline.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Connors | first2 = P.G. | last3 = Pitelka | first3 = F.A. | year = 1979 | title = Territory size in wintering Sanderlings: the effects of prey abundance and intruder density | url = | journal = Auk | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 551–561 }}</ref>

The time to develop territories varies between animals.  The [[marine iguana]] (''Amblyrhynchus cris tatus'') is a [[Lek mating|lekking]] reptile.  Males start to establish small display territories two months ahead of the mating season.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Partecke | first1 = J. | last2 = von Haeseler | first2 = A. | last3 = Wikelski | first3 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Territory establishment in lekking marine iguanas, Amblyrhynchus cris tatus: support for the hotshot mechanism | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume =  51| issue = | pages =  579–587| doi = 10.1007/s00265-002-0469-z }}</ref>

==Retaining a territory==
Rather than retaining a territory simply by fighting, for some animals this can be a 3-stage process.  Many animals create "sign-posts" to advertise their territory.  Sometimes these sign-posts are on the boundary thereby demarcating the territory, or, may be scattered throughout the territory.  These communicate to other animals that the territory is occupied and may also communicate additional information such as the sex, reproductive status or [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] status of the territory-holder.  Sign-posts may communicate information by olfactory, auditory, or visual means, or a combination of these.  If an intruder progresses further into the territory beyond the sign-posts and encounters the territory-holder, both animals may begin "ritualised aggression" toward each other.  This is a series of stylised postures, vocalisations, displays, etc. which function to solve the territory dispute without actual fighting as this could injure either or both animals.  Ritualised aggression often ends by one of the animals fleeing (generally the intruder).  If this does not happen, the territory may be defended by actual fighting, although this is generally a last resort.

====Scent marking====
{{commons category|Scent marking}}
Scent marking, also known as ''territorial marking'' or [[Spraying (animal behavior)|''spraying'']] when this involves [[urination]], is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20020827174310/http://www.sspca.org/TerritorialMarking.html</ref> Most commonly, this is accomplished by depositing strong-smelling substances contained in the [[Urine spraying|urine]], [[feces|faeces]], or, from specialised [[scent gland]]s located on various areas of the body. Often, the scent contains [[pheromones]] or carrier proteins such as the [[major urinary proteins]] to stabilize the odours and maintain them for longer.<ref name=Hurst1>{{cite journal |author=Hurst, J.L., Robertson, D.H.L., Tolladay, U. and Beynon, R.J. |title=Proteins in urine scent marks of male house mice extend the longevity of olfactory signals |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=1289–97 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9632512 |doi= 10.1006/anbe.1997.0650|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/179.full.pdf |title=V133.CHP:Corel VENTURA |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref>  The animal sniffing the scent mark will frequently display a [[flehmen response]] to assist in communication of the information.

Not only does scent marking [[Animal communication|communicate information to conspecifics]], but can also indicate the presence of the territory-holder to [[prey]] species. For example, [[felid]]s such as [[leopard]]s and [[jaguar]]s mark by rubbing themselves against vegetation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Prosimian]]s and [[New World monkey]]s also use scent marking, including urine washing ([[self-anointing]] the body with urine), to communicate.<ref name="Estes1991">{{cite book|author=Richard Estes|title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g977LsZHpcsC&pg=PA464&dq=urine+marking&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LUDZUK2EOsTC0AHTroCoBQ&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=urine%20marking&f=false|accessdate=25 December 2012|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|pages=464–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Nowak | editor1-first = R.

Territorial scent marking may involve behaviours specific to this activity.  When [[Gray wolf#Olfactory|a wolf marks its territory]], it lifts a hind leg and urinates on a scent post (usually an elevated position like a tree, rock, or bush). This [[raised leg urination]] is different from normal urination, which is done while squatting. Usually, this urine marking posture is exclusively performed by female and male alpha wolves, although it is usually the alpha male that does this most often. The alpha female usually urinates on a scent post that her breeding partner has just urinated on, although during the mating season, the female may first urinate on the ground. All other females in the pack, and also young wolves and low-ranking male wolves, will urinate while squatting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alphawolfsabrina.webs.com/theterritory.htm|title=The Territory|publisher=wolfbehavior: All you need to know about Wolves|year=2005|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>  Males and female [[ring-tailed lemur]]s (''Lemur catta'') scent-mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their [[scent gland|anogenital scent gland]]s.

Another example of scent marking can be found in the Eastern carpenter bee, ''[[Eastern carpenter bee|Xylocopa Virginica]].''  Males and females of this species have glands that evolved as a method of marking the nest.  Males, although they have the gland, are unable to produce the marking substance.  Only female carpenter bees of this species are able to secrete the substance, and they produce it near nest site entrance to establish their territory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gerling | first1 = Dan | last2 = Hermann | first2 = Henry R | year = 1978 | title = Biology and mating behavior of Xylocopa virginica L.

====Visual====
[[File:Lemur-ring-tailed.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ring-tailed lemurs hold their distinctive tails high in the air during territorial scent marking.  They also engage in "stink fights" with intruding males.]] 
Visual sign-posts may be a short-term or long-term mode of advertising a territory.  Short-term communication includes the colouration or behaviour of the animal, which can only be communicated when the resident is present. Other animals may use more long-term visual signals such as faecal deposits, or marks on the vegetation or ground.  Visual marking of territory is often combined with other modes of animal communication.

Some animals have prominent "badges"  or visual displays to advertise their territory, often in combination with scent marking or auditory signals.  Male [[European robins]] are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour. They will attack other males that stray into their territories, and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation. Such attacks sometimes lead to fatalities, accounting for up to 10% of adult robin deaths in some areas.<ref name=RSPBterr>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/robin/territory.asp |title= The RSPB-Robin:Territory|accessdate=2008-05-17|work=RSPB website}}</ref>  The red breast of the bird (i.e. badge) is highly visible when it sings (vocal marking) at the boundary of its territory.  The ring-tailed lemur (''Lemur catta'') advertises its territory with urine scent marks.  When it is urinating for marking purposes, it holds its extremely distinctive tail high in the air adding a visual component to the advertisement; when it is urinating for eliminative purposes, its tail is only slightly raised.<ref>Palagi, E. and Dapporto, L., (2006). Urine marking and urination in Lemur catta: a comparison of design features.  ''Ann. Zool. Fennici'', 43: 280-284 [http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf43/anzf43-280.pdf]</ref>
 
[[Rhinoceros]] have poor vision but may use visual marking. Dominant [[white rhino]] bulls mark their territory with faeces and urine (olfactory marking).<ref name="Estes1991">{{cite book|author=Richard Estes|title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g977LsZHpcsC&pg=PA323&dq=spotted+hyena+penis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9BHIUM_LM--x0AHJz4CwCA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=urine%20spray&f=false|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|pages=323–}}</ref> The dung is laid in well defined piles. There may be 20 to 30 of these piles to alert passing rhinoceros that it is occupied territory.  Other males may deposit dung over the piles of another and subsequently the sign-post grows larger and larger.  Such a dung heap can become up to five metres wide and one metre high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/species_of_rhino/greater_one-horned_rhinos/factfile_greater_one-horned_rhino|title=Factfile:Greater one horned rhino|author=von Houwald, F.|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>  After defecating, [[Indian rhinoceros|greater one-horned rhino]]s scratch their hind feet in the dung. By continuing to walk, they “transport” their own smell around the paths, thus establishing a scent-marked trail. Another method of visually marking their territory is wiping their horns on bushes or the ground and scraping with the feet, although this is likely combined with the smell of the marking animal.  The territorial male will scrape-mark every {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} or so around its territory boundary.

After leaving a urination mark, some animals scrape or dig the ground nearby, thereby leaving a visual advertisement of the territory.  This includes domestic [[dog]]s.

[[File:Lemur catta spur and antebrachial gland.jpg|thumb|200px|The antebrachial scent gland and spur on the forearm of a male ring-tailed lemur]]
Several species scratch or chew trees leaving a visual mark of their territory.  This is sometimes combined with rubbing on the tree which may leave tufts of fur.  These include the [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/nwep3d.htm|title=chemical communication|publisher=NatureWorks|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> and the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscentmarkingttrees.html|title=Black Bear Marking Trees|author= Cabrera, K.A.|year=2013|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>Burst, T.L. and Pelton, M.R., (  ).

Bear Res. and Manage., 5: 45-53 [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_5/Burst___Pelton_Vol_5.pdf]</ref>  Many animals have scent glands in their paws or deposit fur during tree-marking, so tree-marking may be a combination of both visual and olfactory advertising of the territory.  The male ring-tailed lemur has a specialised adaptation to assist in leaving visual/olfactory territorial marks.  On their inner forearm (antebrachial) is a scent gland which is covered by a [[Spur (zoology)|spur]].  In a behaviour called "spur marking", they grasp the substrate, usually a small sapling, and drag the spur over it, cutting into the wood and spreading the gland's secretions.  When on the ground, ring-tailed lemurs preferentially mark small saplings and when high in the trees, they usually mark small vertical branches.<ref name="Cawthon Lang" />

[[European wildcat]]s (''Felis silvestris'') deposit their faecal marks on plants with high visual conspicuousness that enhances the visual effectiveness of the signal.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Piñeiro | first1 = A. | last2 = Barja | first2 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The plant physical features selected by wildcats as signal posts: an economic approach to fecal marking | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 801–809 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-012-0962-9 }}</ref>

====Auditory====
Many animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory.  These are short-term signals transmitted only when the animal is present, but can travel long distances and over varied habitats.  Examples of animals which use auditory signals include birds, frogs and canids.
 
{{Listen|filename=Wolf howls.ogg|title=Wolves howling|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Gray wolf|Wolves]] advertise their territories to other packs through a combination of scent marking and howling.  Under certain conditions, wolf howls can be heard over areas of up to {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>Feldhamer, G.A., Thompson, B.C. and Chapman, J.A., (2003). ''Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Conservation''. JHU Press. p.496. ISBN 0801874165</ref>  When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are.<ref>Lopez, B.H., (1978). ''Of Wolves and Men.'' J.M. Dent and Sons Limited. p.38 ISBN 0-7432-4936-4</ref> Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable.<ref>Zimen, E., (1981).

===Ritualised aggression===
[[File:Catch cats 3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Two domestic cats posturing during ritualised aggression over a territory]]
Animals use a range of behaviours to intimidate intruders and defend their territories, but without engaging in fights which are expensive in terms of energy and the risk of injury.  This is ritualised aggression.  Such defense frequently involves a graded series of behaviours or displays that include threatening gestures such as vocalizations, spreading of wings or gill covers, lifting and presentation of claws, head bobbing, tail and body beating, and finally, direct attack. [[Cat|Domestic cats]] (''Felis catus'') are very territorial and will defend this with ritualized body posturing, stalking, staring, spitting, yowling and howling.  Spider monkeys (genus ''Ateles'') defend their territory by screams, barks, rattling or dropping branches, and urinating and defeacating on intruders below.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = C.R. | year = 1935 | title = Behavior of red spider monkeys in Panama | url = | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.2307/1374442 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceray.com/biology/zoology/five-notable-territorial-animals/|title=Five Notable Territorial Animals|author=Regoniel, P.|year=2009|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref>  [[Oscar (fish)|Oscar]] cichlids (''Astronotus ocellatus'') are able to rapidly alter their colouration, a trait which facilitates ritualised territorial and combat behaviours amongst conspecifics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beeching | first1 = S.C. | year = 1995 | title = Colour pattern and inhibition of aggression in the cichlid fish Astronotus ocellatus | url = | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 50–58 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8649.1995.tb01872.x }}</ref> Individuals of another cichlid species, the blunthead cichlid (''[[Tropheus moorii]]''), defend their feeding territory with a display, quivering the tail and fins to intimidate, or an attack, darting at the intruder and chasing them away.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | last1 = Kohda | first1 = M | year = 1991 | title = Intra- and interspecific social organization among three herbivorous cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika | url = | journal = Japanese Journal of Ichthyology | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 147–163 | doi = 10.1007/BF02905540 }}</ref> ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'' cichlids have similar displays of aggressive behaviour if they are territorial, which include threat displays and chasing.

Male ring-tailed lemurs have scent glands on their wrists, chests, and in the genital area.  During encounters with rival males they may perform ritualised aggression by having a "stink fight".  The males anoint their tails by rubbing the ends of their tails on the inside of their wrists and on their chests. They then arch their tails over their bodies and wave them at their opponent. The male toward which this is directed either responds with a display of his own, physical aggression, or flees. "Stink fights" can last from 10 minutes to one hour.<ref name="Cawthon Lang" />

Ritualised aggression can sometimes include actual fights.  The creek chub (''[[Semotilus atromaculatus]]'') engages in ritualized aggression when others of the species invade its territory. Engaging in parallel swimming, the fish widens its fins and mouth and swims at a caudal fin beat. Intimidating opponent fish throughout these rituals, the forward fish stops and directs blows to the head of the other fish to ensure territory dominance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = M.R. | year = 1977 | title = Aggression as a social mechanism in the creek chub (''Semotilus atromaculatus'') | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1977 | issue = 2| pages = 393–397 | doi=10.2307/1443928}}</ref>

===Defense===
Territories may be held by an individual, a [[mated pair|mated]] or unmated pair, or a group. Territoriality is not always a fixed behavioural characteristic of a species.  For example, red foxes (''Vulpes vulpes'') either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with [[no fixed abode]].<ref name="mac117">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1987|p=117}}</ref>  Territories may vary with time (season), for example, [[European robin|robins]] defend territories as pairs during the breeding season but as individuals during the winter.  Resource availability may cause changes in territoriality, for example, some [[nectarivore]]s defend territories only during the mornings when plants are richest in nectar. In species that do not form pair bonds, male and female territories are often independent, i.e. males defend territories only against other males and females only against other females.  In this case, if the species is [[polygyny|polygynous]], one male territory will probably contain several female territories, while in some [[polyandry|polyandrous]] species such as the [[northern jacana]], this situation is reversed.

==Strategies==
Animals may use several strategies to defend their territories.

The first [[Game theory#Biology|game theory model]] of fighting is known as the ''[[Chicken (game)|hawk-dove game]]''. This model pits a hawk strategy (always try to injure your opponent and only withdraw from the contest if an injury is received) against a dove strategy (always use a non-injurious display if the rival is another dove and always withdraw if the rival is a hawk).

Another strategy used in territory defence is the [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]].  In this model of aggression, two contestants compete for a resource by persisting while constantly accumulating costs over the time that the contest lasts.  Strategically, the game is an auction in which the prize goes to the player with the highest bid, and each player pays the loser's low bid.

Some animals use a strategy termed the ''[[dear enemy effect]]'' in which two neighbouring territorial animals become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established and they are familiar to each other, but aggression toward unfamiliar animals remains unaffected.<ref>Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83</ref>  The converse of this is the ''[[nasty neighbour effect]]'' in which a territory-holder shows heightened aggression toward neighbouring territory-holders but unaffected aggression to unfamiliar animals or distant territory-holders.  These contrasting strategies depend on which intruder (familiar or unfamiliar) poses the greatest threat to the resident territory-holder.<ref>Müller, C.A. and Manser, M.B., (2007). ‘Nasty neighbours’ rather than ‘dear enemies’ in a social carnivore. Proc. R. Soc. B., 274: 959-965</ref>

In territory defence by groups of animals, ''[[reciprocal altruism]]'' can operate whereby the cost to the benefactor in helping defend the territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary.

==Resources defended==
An animal chooses its territory by deciding what part of its home range it will defend. In selecting a territory, the size and quality play crucial roles in determining an animal's habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism requires to survive, because defending a larger territory incurs greater energy, time and risk of injury costs. For some animals, the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of the defended territory.

Behavioural ecologists have argued that food distribution determines whether a species will be territorial or not, however, this may be too narrow a perspective. Several other type of resource may be defended including partners, potential mates, offspring, nests or lairs, display areas or [[lek (animal behavior)|leks]]. Territoriality will emerge where there is a focused resource that provides enough for the individual or group, within a boundary that is small enough to be defended without the expenditure of excessive effort. Territoriality is often most strong towards [[conspecifics]], as shown in the case of [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blenny]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nursall|first=J.R.|title=Territoriality in Redlip blennies (Ophioblennius atlanticus-Pisces: Blenniidae)|journal=Journal of Zoology|year=1977|volume=182|series=2|pages=205–223|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04156.x}}</ref> This is because the conspecifics share exactly the same set of resources.

Several types of resource in a territory may be defended.
[[File:Vanellus vanellus mobbing Circus aeruginosus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A western marsh harrier is mobbed by a northern lapwing. The marsh harrier, a male, had been quartering the ground in which lapwing and redshank were nesting.]]

'''Food:''' Large solitary (or paired) carnivores, such as [[bear]]s and the bigger [[Bird of prey|raptors]] require an extensive protected area to guarantee their food supply. This territoriality will only break down when there is a glut of food, for example when [[grizzly bear]]s are attracted to migrating [[salmon]].

Food related territoriality is least likely with insectivorous birds, where the food supply is plentiful but unpredictably distributed. [[Swift]]s rarely defend an area larger than the nest. Conversely, other insectivorous birds that occupy more constrained territories, such as the ground-nesting [[blacksmith lapwing]] may be very territorial, especially in the breeding season during which they not only threaten or attack many kinds of intruders, but have stereotyped display behaviour to deter conspecifics sharing neighbouring nesting spots.

The [[owl limpet]] (''Lottia gigantea'') is a large (up to 8&nbsp;cm in length) limpet.  It lives in association with an approximately 1,000&nbsp;cm^2 area of algal film in which its grazing marks can be seen, whereas the remainder of the rock surface is usually free of any visible film. These areas of algal film represent the territories of the Lottia; within them the animals do all their grazing. They keep their territories free of other organisms by shoving off any intruders: other Lottia, grazing limpets of the genus Acmaea, predatory snails, and sessile organisms such as anemones and barnacles.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1933604 | last1 = Stimson | first1 = J. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1969 | title = Territoriality of the owl limpet ''Lottia gigantea'' | jstor = 1933604| journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 113–118 }}</ref>

'''Nests and offspring:'''  Many birds, particularly seabirds, nest in dense communities but are nonetheless territorial in  defending their nesting site to within the distance they can reach while brooding. This is necessary to prevent attacks on their own chicks or nesting material from neighbours. Commonly the resulting superimposition of the short-range repulsion onto the long-range attraction characteristically leads to the well-known roughly hexagonal spacing of nests. Interestingly, one gets a similar hexagonal spacing resulting from the territorial behaviour of gardening limpets such as species of [[Scutellastra]]<ref>Branch,G.M., Griffiths,C., Beckley,L.E., Branch,M.L.; Two Oceans. Pub. Struik, 2010. ISBN 978-1-77007-772-0</ref> They vigorously defend their gardens of particular species of algae, that extend for perhaps 1–2&nbsp;cm around the periphery of their shells.

Some species of penguin will defend their nest from intruders trying to steal the pebbles from which the nest is constructed.<ref name="Ehrlich" />

'''Mating opportunities:'''  The striped mouse (''[[Rhabdomys]] pumilio'') is group living with one single breeding male and up to 4 communally breeding females per group. Groups typically contain several [[philopatric]] adult sons (and daughters) that are believed not to breed in their natal group and all group members participate in territorial defence.  Males defend their territory using a nasty neignbour strategy. Group-living male breeders are nearly five times more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards strangers, leading to the prediction that neighbours are the most important competitors for paternity. Using a molecular parentage analysis it has been shown that 28% of offspring are sired by neighbouring males and only 7% by strangers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schradin | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = C. | last3 = Lindholm | first3 = A.K. | year = 2010 | title = The nasty neighbour in the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) steals paternity and elicits aggression | url = | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 19 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-7-19 }}</ref> In certain species of butterflies, such as the [[Australian painted lady]] butterfly and the [[Speckled wood (butterfly)|speckled wood butterfly]], the male will defend territories that receptive females are likely to fly through such as sunny hilltops and sunspots on a forest's floor.<ref name="Alcock and Gwynne, 1988">{{cite journal|last=Alcock|first=John|author2=Gwynne Daryl |title=The mating system of Vanessa kershawi: Males defend landmark territories as mate encounter sites|journal=Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera|year=1988|volume=26|issue=1-4|pages=116–124}}</ref><ref name="Davies 1978">{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=N.B.|title=Territorial defense in the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria): The resident always wins|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=1978|volume=26|pages=138–147|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(78)90013-1}}</ref>

Territory defence in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.  Reduced aggression consistent with the dear enemy effect occurs between conspecific neighbours in the absence of females, but the presence of a female in a male's territory instigates comparably greater aggression between the neighbours.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leiser | first1 = J.K. | year = 2003 | title = When are neighbours 'dear enemies' and when are they not?

In the [[Skylark]] (''Alauda arvensis''), playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season show that neighbours are dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories are stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increases due to the presence of young birds becoming independent. Thus, this dear enemy territoriality relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Briefer | first1 = E. | last2 = Rybak | first2 = F. | last3 = Aubin | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 1319–1325 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.06.017}}</ref>

Some species of bees also exhibit territoriality to defend mating sites. For example, in ''[[Euglossa imperialis]],'' a non-social bee species, males have been observed to occasionally form aggregations of fragrance-rich territories, considered to be leks. These leks serve only a facultative purpose for this species, in which the more fragrance-rich sites there are, the greater the number of habitable territories. Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate within the aggregation, giving females the power of mate choice.<ref>Kimsey, Lynn Siri. "The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks." Animal Behaviour 28.4 (1980): 996-1004.</ref> Similar behaviour is also observed in the ''[[Eulaema meriana]]'' orchid bee. Males in this species of bee show alternative behaviours of territoriality and transiency. Transient male bees did not defend territories, but instead flew from one territory to the other. They also did not engage in physical contact with the territorial males. On the other hand, territorial males patrolled an area around a tree and used the same territory for up to 49 days. It also appeared that they gave up territories to new males without violence. Males defend territories solely for mating, and no other resources such as fragrances, nests, nest construction materials, nectar, or pollen are found at these territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Male Territoriality and Alternative Male Behaviors in the Euglossine Bee, Eulaema meriana (Hymenoptera: Apidae)|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1991-10-01|pages = 421–437|volume = 64|issue = 4|first = David L.|last = Stern|jstor=25085309}}</ref>

===Single resource territories===
Although most territories contain multiple (potential) resources, some territories are defended for only one purpose. [[Common blackbird|European blackbirds]] may defend feeding territories that are distant from their nest sites, and in some species that form leks, for example in the [[Kob|Uganda kob]] (a [[grazing antelope]]) and the marine iguana, males defend the lek site which is used only for mating.

==Polyterritoriality==
Many species demonstrate polyterritoriality, referring to the act of claiming or defending more than one territory. In the [[European pied flycatcher]] (''Ficedula hypoleuca''), researchers assert that males exhibit polyterritoriality to deceive females of the species into entering into polygynous relationships. This hypothesis, named the [[Deception in animals|deception]] hypothesis, claims that males have territories at distances sufficiently great  that females will not be able to discern already-mated males. The observation that males travelled long distances, ranging from 200m to 3.5&nbsp;km, to find a second mate supports this the argument.<ref name="jstor">{{cite journal| last= Alatalo | first= Rauno V. |author2=Carlson, Allan |author3=Lundberg, Arne |author4=Ulfstrand, Staffan | year= 1981| title= The Conflict Between Male Polygamy and Female Monogamy: The Case of the Pied Flycatcher ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' | journal= The American Naturalist | volume= 117 |language = | issue = 5 | pages= 738–753 | url = | doi =10.1086/283756 }}</ref> The debate about polyterritoriality in this species may initiate research about the evolution and reasons for polyterritoriality in other unrelated species.
